# My-Gallery-Project
My Gallery is a sleek and visually engaging website that displays a dynamic image gallery. Built using HTML and CSS, this project showcases a parallax-inspired hover effect and grayscale-to-color transitions, offering a modern, interactive browsing experience.
Features
Interactive Cards: Each image card features grayscale styling, transforming into vibrant colors upon hover.
Smooth Animations: Hover effects include subtle scaling and shadow transitions for a professional touch.
Responsive Design: The gallery adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes with a flexible grid layout.
Learning Inspiration
This project was created while exploring front-end development through Love Babbarâ€™s tutorials, focusing on mastering CSS transitions, responsive layouts, and modern design principles.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content and layout.
CSS: For styling, animations, and responsive behavior.
How to Use
Clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser to view the gallery. The code is clean and easy to customize, allowing you to replace images or modify the design for your own projects.

Future Enhancements
Adding JavaScript to enable advanced functionality like lightbox previews.
